N    * The format is composed of zero or more directives: one or more
N    * white-space characters; an ordinary character (not %); or a conversion
N    * specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the
N    * character %. For a description of the available conversion specifiers
N    * refer to section 4.9.6.2 in the ANSI draft mentioned at the start of this
N    * file, or to any modern textbook on C.
N    * If end-of-file is encountered during input, conversion is terminated. If
N    * end-of-file occurs before any characters matching the current directive
N    * have been read (other than leading white space, where permitted),
N    * execution of the current directive terminates with an input failure;
N    * otherwise, unless execution of the current directive is terminated with a
N    * matching failure, execution of the following directive (if any) is
N    * terminated with an input failure.
N    * If conversions terminates on a conflicting input character, the offending
N    * input character is left unread in the input strem. Trailing white space
N    * (including new-line characters) is left unread unless matched by a
N    * directive. The success of literal matches and suppressed asignments is
N    * not directly determinable other than via the %n directive.

N     * Copies or moves a piece of memory from one place to another,
N     * with one-bit granularity. So you can start or finish a copy
N     * part way through a byte, and you can copy between regions
N     * with different alignment within a byte.
N     * 
N     * All these functions have the same prototype: two void *
N     * pointers for destination and source, then two integers
N     * giving the bit offset from those pointers, and finally the
N     * number of bits to copy.
N     * 
N     * Just like memcpy and memmove, the "cpy" functions copy as
N     * fast as they can in the assumption that the memory regions
N     * do not overlap, while the "move" functions cope correctly
N     * with overlap.
N     *
N     * Treating memory as a stream of individual bits requires
N     * defining a convention about what order those bits are
N     * considered to be arranged in. The above functions support
N     * multiple conventions:
N     * 
N     *  - the "bl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
N     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
N     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
N     * 
N     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
N     *    first.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.

N * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
N * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
N * application code.
N *
N * list_ts can only store pointers to list_item_ts.  Each ListItem_t contains a
N * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
N * descending item value order.
N *
N * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
N * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
N * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
N * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
N * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
N * the list.
N *
N * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
N * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
N * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
N * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
N * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
N * the list item itself.

N * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore

N * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
N * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
N * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
N * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
N * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective

N * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
N * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
N * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
N * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
N * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
N * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
N * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
N * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
N * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
N * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
N * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below

N *
N * Create a new task and add it to the list of tasks that are ready to run.
N *
N * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, tasks use two blocks of
N * memory.  The first block is used to hold the task's data structures.  The
N * second block is used by the task as its stack.  If a task is created using
N * xTaskCreate() then both blocks of memory are automatically dynamically
N * allocated inside the xTaskCreate() function.  (see
N * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a task is created using
N * xTaskCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the required
N * memory.  xTaskCreateStatic() therefore allows a task to be created without
N * using any dynamic memory allocation.
N *
N * See xTaskCreateStatic() for a version that does not use any dynamic memory
N * allocation.
N *
N * xTaskCreate() can only be used to create a task that has unrestricted
N * access to the entire microcontroller memory map.  Systems that include MPU
N * support can alternatively create an MPU constrained task using
N * xTaskCreateRestricted().
N *
N * @param pvTaskCode Pointer to the task entry function.  Tasks
N * must be implemented to never return (i.e. continuous loop).
N *
N * @param pcName A descriptive name for the task.  This is mainly used to
N * facilitate debugging.  Max length defined by configMAX_TASK_NAME_LEN - default
N * is 16.
N *
N * @param usStackDepth The size of the task stack specified as the number of
N * variables the stack can hold - not the number of bytes.  For example, if
N * the stack is 16 bits wide and usStackDepth is defined as 100, 200 bytes
N * will be allocated for stack storage.
N *
N * @param pvParameters Pointer that will be used as the parameter for the task
N * being created.
N *
N * @param uxPriority The priority at which the task should run.  Systems that
N * include MPU support can optionally create tasks in a privileged (system)
N * mode by setting bit portPRIVILEGE_BIT of the priority parameter.  For
N * example, to create a privileged task at priority 2 the uxPriority parameter
N * should be set to ( 2 | portPRIVILEGE_BIT ).
N *
N * @param pvCreatedTask Used to pass back a handle by which the created task
N * can be referenced.
N *
N * @return pdPASS if the task was successfully created and added to a ready
N * list, otherwise an error code defined in the file projdefs.h
N *

N * task. h
N * <pre>void vTaskDelay( const TickType_t xTicksToDelay );</pre>
N *
N * Delay a task for a given number of ticks.  The actual time that the
N * task remains blocked depends on the tick rate.  The constant
N * portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
N * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
N *
N * INCLUDE_vTaskDelay must be defined as 1 for this function to be available.
N * See the configuration section for more information.
N *
N *
N * vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to
N * the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.  For example, specifying a block
N * period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after
N * vTaskDelay() is called.  vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method
N * of controlling the frequency of a periodic task as the path taken through the
N * code, as well as other task and interrupt activity, will effect the frequency
N * at which vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task
N * next executes.  See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed
N * to facilitate fixed frequency execution.  It does this by specifying an
N * absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should
N * unblock.
N *
N * @param xTicksToDelay The amount of time, in tick periods, that
N * the calling task should block.
N *
N * Example usage:

N * See the configuration section for more information.
N *
N * Delay a task until a specified time.  This function can be used by periodic
N * tasks to ensure a constant execution frequency.
N *
N * This function differs from vTaskDelay () in one important aspect:  vTaskDelay () will
N * cause a task to block for the specified number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay () is
N * called.  It is therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay () by itself to generate a fixed
N * execution frequency as the time between a task starting to execute and that task
N * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
N * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
N * each time it executes].
N *
N * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
N * is called, vTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
N * unblock.
N *
N * The constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
N * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
N *
N * @param pxPreviousWakeTime Pointer to a variable that holds the time at which the

N *
N * @param xTimeIncrement The cycle time period.  The task will be unblocked at
N * time *pxPreviousWakeTime + xTimeIncrement.  Calling vTaskDelayUntil with the
N * same xTimeIncrement parameter value will cause the task to execute with
N * a fixed interface period.

N *
N * @param eAction Specifies how the notification updates the task's notification
N * value, if at all.  Valid values for eAction are as follows:
N *
N * eSetBits -
N * The task's notification value is bitwise ORed with ulValue.  xTaskNofify()
N * always returns pdPASS in this case.
N *
N * eIncrement -
N * The task's notification value is incremented.  ulValue is not used and
N * xTaskNotify() always returns pdPASS in this case.
N *
N * eSetValueWithOverwrite -
N * The task's notification value is set to the value of ulValue, even if the
N * task being notified had not yet processed the previous notification (the
N * task already had a notification pending).  xTaskNotify() always returns
N * pdPASS in this case.
N *
N * eSetValueWithoutOverwrite -
N * If the task being notified did not already have a notification pending then
N * the task's notification value is set to ulValue and xTaskNotify() will
N * return pdPASS.  If the task being notified already had a notification
N * pending then no action is performed and pdFAIL is returned.
N *
N * eNoAction -
N * The task receives a notification without its notification value being
N * updated.  ulValue is not used and xTaskNotify() always returns pdPASS in
N * this case.
N *
N * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken  xTaskNotifyFromISR() will set
N * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken to pdTRUE if sending the notification caused the
N * task to which the notification was sent to leave the Blocked state, and the
N * unblocked task has a priority higher than the currently running task.  If
N * xTaskNotifyFromISR() sets this value to pdTRUE then a context switch should
N * be requested before the interrupt is exited.  How a context switch is
N * requested from an ISR is dependent on the port - see the documentation page
N * for the port in use.

N *
N * Events can be sent to a task using an intermediary object.  Examples of such
N * objects are queues, semaphores, mutexes and event groups.  Task notifications
N * are a method of sending an event directly to a task without the need for such
N * an intermediary object.
N *
N * A notification sent to a task can optionally perform an action, such as
N * update, overwrite or increment the task's notification value.  In that way
N * task notifications can be used to send data to a task, or be used as light
N * weight and fast binary or counting semaphores.
N *
N * A notification sent to a task will remain pending until it is cleared by the
N * task calling xTaskNotifyWait() or ulTaskNotifyTake().  If the task was
N * already in the Blocked state to wait for a notification when the notification
N * arrives then the task will automatically be removed from the Blocked state
N * (unblocked) and the notification cleared.
N *
N * A task can use xTaskNotifyWait() to [optionally] block to wait for a
N * notification to be pending, or ulTaskNotifyTake() to [optionally] block
N * to wait for its notification value to have a non-zero value.  The task does
N * not consume any CPU time while it is in the Blocked state.
N *
N * See http://www.FreeRTOS.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html for details.
N *
N * @param ulBitsToClearOnEntry Bits that are set in ulBitsToClearOnEntry value
N * will be cleared in the calling task's notification value before the task
N * checks to see if any notifications are pending, and optionally blocks if no
N * notifications are pending.  Setting ulBitsToClearOnEntry to ULONG_MAX (if
N * limits.h is included) or 0xffffffffUL (if limits.h is not included) will have
N * the effect of resetting the task's notification value to 0.  Setting
N * ulBitsToClearOnEntry to 0 will leave the task's notification value unchanged.
N *
N * @param ulBitsToClearOnExit If a notification is pending or received before
N * the calling task exits the xTaskNotifyWait() function then the task's
N * notification value (see the xTaskNotify() API function) is passed out using
N * the pulNotificationValue parameter.  Then any bits that are set in
N * ulBitsToClearOnExit will be cleared in the task's notification value (note
N * *pulNotificationValue is set before any bits are cleared).  Setting
N * ulBitsToClearOnExit to ULONG_MAX (if limits.h is included) or 0xffffffffUL
N * (if limits.h is not included) will have the effect of resetting the task's
N * notification value to 0 before the function exits.  Setting
N * ulBitsToClearOnExit to 0 will leave the task's notification value unchanged
N * when the function exits (in which case the value passed out in
N * pulNotificationValue will match the task's notification value).
N *
N * @param pulNotificationValue Used to pass the task's notification value out
N * of the function.  Note the value passed out will not be effected by the
N * clearing of any bits caused by ulBitsToClearOnExit being non-zero.
N *
N * @param xTicksToWait The maximum amount of time that the task should wait in
N * the Blocked state for a notification to be received, should a notification
N * not already be pending when xTaskNotifyWait() was called.  The task
N * will not consume any processing time while it is in the Blocked state.  This
N * is specified in kernel ticks, the macro pdMS_TO_TICSK( value_in_ms ) can be
N * used to convert a time specified in milliseconds to a time specified in

N *
N * A queue set must be explicitly created using a call to xQueueCreateSet()
N * before it can be used.  Once created, standard FreeRTOS queues and semaphores
N * can be added to the set using calls to xQueueAddToSet().
N * xQueueSelectFromSet() is then used to determine which, if any, of the queues

N * semaphore take operation would be successful.
N *
N * Note 1:  See the documentation on http://wwwFreeRTOS.org/RTOS-queue-sets.html
N * for reasons why queue sets are very rarely needed in practice as there are
N * simpler methods of blocking on multiple objects.
N *
N * Note 2:  Blocking on a queue set that contains a mutex will not cause the
N * mutex holder to inherit the priority of the blocked task.
N *
N * Note 3:  An additional 4 bytes of RAM is required for each space in a every
N * queue added to a queue set.  Therefore counting semaphores that have a high
N * maximum count value should not be added to a queue set.
N *
N * Note 4:  A receive (in the case of a queue) or take (in the case of a

N * a call to xQueueSelectFromSet() has first returned a handle to that set member.
N *
N * @param uxEventQueueLength Queue sets store events that occur on
N * the queues and semaphores contained in the set.  uxEventQueueLength specifies
N * the maximum number of events that can be queued at once.  To be absolutely
N * certain that events are not lost uxEventQueueLength should be set to the
N * total sum of the length of the queues added to the set, where binary
N * semaphores and mutexes have a length of 1, and counting semaphores have a
N * length set by their maximum count value.  Examples:
N *  + If a queue set is to hold a queue of length 5, another queue of length 12,
N *    and a binary semaphore, then uxEventQueueLength should be set to

N *  + If a queue set is to hold three binary semaphores then uxEventQueueLength
N *    should be set to (1 + 1 + 1 ), or 3.
N *  + If a queue set is to hold a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of
N *    5, and a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of 3, then

N *
N * This old vSemaphoreCreateBinary() macro is now deprecated in favour of the

N * The queue length is 1 as this is a binary semaphore.  The data size is 0
N * as we don't want to actually store any data - we just want to know if the
N * queue is empty or full.
N *
N * This type of semaphore can be used for pure synchronisation between tasks or

N *
N * 2) Resource management.
N *
N *    In this usage scenario the count value indicates the number of resources

S
S/*
S * The ALLOC_CACHE_ALIGN_BUFFER macro is used to allocate a buffer on the
S * stack that meets the minimum architecture alignment requirements for DMA.
S * Such a buffer is useful for DMA operations where flushing and invalidating
S * the cache before and after a read and/or write operation is required for
S * correct operations.
S *
S * When called the macro creates an array on the stack that is sized such
S * that:
S *
S * 1) The beginning of the array can be advanced enough to be aligned.
S *
S * 2) The size of the aligned portion of the array is a multiple of the minimum
S *    architecture alignment required for DMA.
S *
S * 3) The aligned portion contains enough space for the original number of
S *    elements requested.
S *
S * The macro then creates a pointer to the aligned portion of this array and
S * assigns to the pointer the address of the first element in the aligned
S * portion of the array.
S *
S * Calling the macro as:
S *
S *     ALLOC_CACHE_ALIGN_BUFFER(uint32_t, buffer, 1024);
S *
S * Will result in something similar to saying:
S *
S *     uint32_t    buffer[1024];
S *
S * The following differences exist:
S *
S * 1) The resulting buffer is guaranteed to be aligned to the value of
S *    ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN.
S *
S * 2) The buffer variable created by the macro is a pointer to the specified
S *    type, and NOT an array of the specified type.  This can be very important
S *    if you want the address of the buffer, which you probably do, to pass it
S *    to the DMA hardware.  The value of &buffer is different in the two cases.
S *    In the macro case it will be the address of the pointer, not the address
S *    of the space reserved for the buffer.  However, in the second case it
S *    would be the address of the buffer.  So if you are replacing hard coded
S *    stack buffers with this macro you need to make sure you remove the & from
S *    the locations where you are taking the address of the buffer.
S *
S * Note that the size parameter is the number of array elements to allocate,
S * not the number of bytes.
S *
S * This macro can not be used outside of function scope, or for the creation
S * of a function scoped static buffer.  It can not be used to create a cache
S * line aligned global buffer.

N  A version of malloc/free/realloc written by Doug Lea and released to the
N  public domain.  Send questions/comments/complaints/performance data
N  to dl@cs.oswego.edu
N
N* VERSION 2.6.6  Sun Mar  5 19:10:03 2000  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)
N
N   Note: There may be an updated version of this malloc obtainable at
N	   ftp://g.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c
N	 Check before installing!
N
N* Why use this malloc?
N
N  This is not the fastest, most space-conserving, most portable, or
N  most tunable malloc ever written. However it is among the fastest
N  while also being among the most space-conserving, portable and tunable.
N  Consistent balance across these factors results in a good general-purpose
N  allocator. For a high-level description, see
N     http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html
N
N* Synopsis of public routines
N
N  (Much fuller descriptions are contained in the program documentation below.)
N
N  malloc(size_t n);
N     Return a pointer to a newly allocated chunk of at least n bytes, or null
N     if no space is available.
N  free(Void_t* p);
N     Release the chunk of memory pointed to by p, or no effect if p is null.
N  realloc(Void_t* p, size_t n);
N     Return a pointer to a chunk of size n that contains the same data
N     as does chunk p up to the minimum of (n, p's size) bytes, or null
N     if no space is available. The returned pointer may or may not be
N     the same as p. If p is null, equivalent to malloc.  Unless the
N     #define REALLOC_ZERO_BYTES_FREES below is set, realloc with a
N     size argument of zero (re)allocates a minimum-sized chunk.
N  memalign(size_t alignment, size_t n);
N     Return a pointer to a newly allocated chunk of n bytes, aligned
N     in accord with the alignment argument, which must be a power of
N     two.
N  valloc(size_t n);
N     Equivalent to memalign(pagesize, n), where pagesize is the page
N     size of the system (or as near to this as can be figured out from
N     all the includes/defines below.)
N  pvalloc(size_t n);
N     Equivalent to valloc(minimum-page-that-holds(n)), that is,
N     round up n to nearest pagesize.
N  calloc(size_t unit, size_t quantity);
N     Returns a pointer to quantity * unit bytes, with all locations
N     set to zero.
N  cfree(Void_t* p);
N     Equivalent to free(p).
N  malloc_trim(size_t pad);
N     Release all but pad bytes of freed top-most memory back
N     to the system. Return 1 if successful, else 0.
N  malloc_usable_size(Void_t* p);
N     Report the number usable allocated bytes associated with allocated
N     chunk p. This may or may not report more bytes than were requested,
N     due to alignment and minimum size constraints.
N  malloc_stats();
N     Prints brief summary statistics on stderr.
N  mallinfo()
N     Returns (by copy) a struct containing various summary statistics.
N  mallopt(int parameter_number, int parameter_value)
N     Changes one of the tunable parameters described below. Returns
N     1 if successful in changing the parameter, else 0.
N
N* Vital statistics:
N
N  Alignment:                            8-byte
N       8 byte alignment is currently hardwired into the design.  This
N       seems to suffice for all current machines and C compilers.
N
N  Assumed pointer representation:       4 or 8 bytes
N       Code for 8-byte pointers is untested by me but has worked
N       reliably by Wolfram Gloger, who contributed most of the
N       changes supporting this.
N
N  Assumed size_t  representation:       4 or 8 bytes
N       Note that size_t is allowed to be 4 bytes even if pointers are 8.
N
N  Minimum overhead per allocated chunk: 4 or 8 bytes
N       Each malloced chunk has a hidden overhead of 4 bytes holding size
N       and status information.
N
N  Minimum allocated size: 4-byte ptrs:  16 bytes    (including 4 overhead)
N			  8-byte ptrs:  24/32 bytes (including, 4/8 overhead)
N
N       When a chunk is freed, 12 (for 4byte ptrs) or 20 (for 8 byte
N       ptrs but 4 byte size) or 24 (for 8/8) additional bytes are
N       needed; 4 (8) for a trailing size field
N       and 8 (16) bytes for free list pointers. Thus, the minimum
N       allocatable size is 16/24/32 bytes.
N
N       Even a request for zero bytes (i.e., malloc(0)) returns a
N       pointer to something of the minimum allocatable size.
N
N  Maximum allocated size: 4-byte size_t: 2^31 -  8 bytes
N			  8-byte size_t: 2^63 - 16 bytes
N
N       It is assumed that (possibly signed) size_t bit values suffice to
N       represent chunk sizes. `Possibly signed' is due to the fact
N       that `size_t' may be defined on a system as either a signed or
N       an unsigned type. To be conservative, values that would appear
N       as negative numbers are avoided.
N       Requests for sizes with a negative sign bit when the request
N       size is treaded as a long will return null.
N
N  Maximum overhead wastage per allocated chunk: normally 15 bytes
N
N       Alignnment demands, plus the minimum allocatable size restriction
N       make the normal worst-case wastage 15 bytes (i.e., up to 15
N       more bytes will be allocated than were requested in malloc), with
N       two exceptions:
N	 1. Because requests for zero bytes allocate non-zero space,
N	    the worst case wastage for a request of zero bytes is 24 bytes.
N	 2. For requests >= mmap_threshold that are serviced via
N	    mmap(), the worst case wastage is 8 bytes plus the remainder
N	    from a system page (the minimal mmap unit); typically 4096 bytes.
N
N* Limitations
N
N    Here are some features that are NOT currently supported
N
N    * No user-definable hooks for callbacks and the like.
N    * No automated mechanism for fully checking that all accesses
N      to malloced memory stay within their bounds.
N    * No support for compaction.
N
N* Synopsis of compile-time options:
N
N    People have reported using previous versions of this malloc on all
N    versions of Unix, sometimes by tweaking some of the defines
N    below. It has been tested most extensively on Solaris and
N    Linux. It is also reported to work on WIN32 platforms.
N    People have also reported adapting this malloc for use in
N    stand-alone embedded systems.
N
N    The implementation is in straight, hand-tuned ANSI C.  Among other
N    consequences, it uses a lot of macros.  Because of this, to be at
N    all usable, this code should be compiled using an optimizing compiler
N    (for example gcc -O2) that can simplify expressions and control
N    paths.
N
N  __STD_C                  (default: derived from C compiler defines)
N     Nonzero if using ANSI-standard C compiler, a C++ compiler, or
N     a C compiler sufficiently close to ANSI to get away with it.
N  DEBUG                    (default: NOT defined)
N     Define to enable debugging. Adds fairly extensive assertion-based
N     checking to help track down memory errors, but noticeably slows down
N     execution.
N  REALLOC_ZERO_BYTES_FREES (default: NOT defined)
N     Define this if you think that realloc(p, 0) should be equivalent
N     to free(p). Otherwise, since malloc returns a unique pointer for
N     malloc(0), so does realloc(p, 0).
N  HAVE_MEMCPY               (default: defined)
N     Define if you are not otherwise using ANSI STD C, but still
N     have memcpy and memset in your C library and want to use them.
N     Otherwise, simple internal versions are supplied.
N  USE_MEMCPY               (default: 1 if HAVE_MEMCPY is defined, 0 otherwise)
N     Define as 1 if you want the C library versions of memset and
N     memcpy called in realloc and calloc (otherwise macro versions are used).
N     At least on some platforms, the simple macro versions usually
N     outperform libc versions.
N  HAVE_MMAP                 (default: defined as 1)
N     Define to non-zero to optionally make malloc() use mmap() to
N     allocate very large blocks.
N  HAVE_MREMAP                 (default: defined as 0 unless Linux libc set)
N     Define to non-zero to optionally make realloc() use mremap() to
N     reallocate very large blocks.
N  malloc_getpagesize        (default: derived from system #includes)
N     Either a constant or routine call returning the system page size.
N  HAVE_USR_INCLUDE_MALLOC_H (default: NOT defined)
N     Optionally define if you are on a system with a /usr/include/malloc.h
N     that declares struct mallinfo. It is not at all necessary to
N     define this even if you do, but will ensure consistency.
N  INTERNAL_SIZE_T           (default: size_t)
N     Define to a 32-bit type (probably `unsigned int') if you are on a
N     64-bit machine, yet do not want or need to allow malloc requests of
N     greater than 2^31 to be handled. This saves space, especially for
N     very small chunks.
N  INTERNAL_LINUX_C_LIB      (default: NOT defined)
N     Defined only when compiled as part of Linux libc.
N     Also note that there is some odd internal name-mangling via defines
N     (for example, internally, `malloc' is named `mALLOc') needed
N     when compiling in this case. These look funny but don't otherwise
N     affect anything.
N  WIN32                     (default: undefined)
N     Define this on MS win (95, nt) platforms to compile in sbrk emulation.
N  LACKS_UNISTD_H            (default: undefined if not WIN32)
N     Define this if your system does not have a <unistd.h>.
N  LACKS_SYS_PARAM_H         (default: undefined if not WIN32)
N     Define this if your system does not have a <sys/param.h>.
N  MORECORE                  (default: sbrk)
N     The name of the routine to call to obtain more memory from the system.
N  MORECORE_FAILURE          (default: -1)
N     The value returned upon failure of MORECORE.
N  MORECORE_CLEARS           (default 1)
N     true (1) if the routine mapped to MORECORE zeroes out memory (which
N     holds for sbrk).
N  DEFAULT_TRIM_THRESHOLD
N  DEFAULT_TOP_PAD
N  DEFAULT_MMAP_THRESHOLD
N  DEFAULT_MMAP_MAX
N     Default values of tunable parameters (described in detail below)
N     controlling interaction with host system routines (sbrk, mmap, etc).
N     These values may also be changed dynamically via mallopt(). The
N     preset defaults are those that give best performance for typical
N     programs/systems.
N  USE_DL_PREFIX             (default: undefined)
N     Prefix all public routines with the string 'dl'.  Useful to
N     quickly avoid procedure declaration conflicts and linker symbol
N     conflicts with existing memory allocation routines.

N    Debugging:
N
N    Because freed chunks may be overwritten with link fields, this
N    malloc will often die when freed memory is overwritten by user
N    programs.  This can be very effective (albeit in an annoying way)
N    in helping track down dangling pointers.
N
N    If you compile with -DDEBUG, a number of assertion checks are
N    enabled that will catch more memory errors. You probably won't be
N    able to make much sense of the actual assertion errors, but they
N    should help you locate incorrectly overwritten memory.  The
N    checking is fairly extensive, and will slow down execution
N    noticeably. Calling malloc_stats or mallinfo with DEBUG set will
N    attempt to check every non-mmapped allocated and free chunk in the
N    course of computing the summmaries. (By nature, mmapped regions
N    cannot be checked very much automatically.)
N
N    Setting DEBUG may also be helpful if you are trying to modify

N  This version of malloc supports the standard SVID/XPG mallinfo
N  routine that returns a struct containing the same kind of
N  information you can get from malloc_stats. It should work on
N  any SVID/XPG compliant system that has a /usr/include/malloc.h
N  defining struct mallinfo. (If you'd like to install such a thing
N  yourself, cut out the preliminary declarations as described above
N  and below and save them in a malloc.h file. But there's no
N  compelling reason to bother to do this.)
N
N  The main declaration needed is the mallinfo struct that is returned
N  (by-copy) by mallinfo().  The SVID/XPG malloinfo struct contains a
N  bunch of fields, most of which are not even meaningful in this
N  version of malloc. Some of these fields are are instead filled by
N  mallinfo() with other numbers that might possibly be of interest.
N
N  HAVE_USR_INCLUDE_MALLOC_H should be set if you have a
N  /usr/include/malloc.h file that includes a declaration of struct
N  mallinfo.  If so, it is included; else an SVID2/XPG2 compliant
N  version is declared below.  These must be precisely the same for
N  mallinfo() to work.

N    M_TRIM_THRESHOLD is the maximum amount of unused top-most memory
N      to keep before releasing via malloc_trim in free().
N
N      Automatic trimming is mainly useful in long-lived programs.
N      Because trimming via sbrk can be slow on some systems, and can
N      sometimes be wasteful (in cases where programs immediately
N      afterward allocate more large chunks) the value should be high
N      enough so that your overall system performance would improve by
N      releasing.
N
N      The trim threshold and the mmap control parameters (see below)
N      can be traded off with one another. Trimming and mmapping are
N      two different ways of releasing unused memory back to the
N      system. Between these two, it is often possible to keep
N      system-level demands of a long-lived program down to a bare
N      minimum. For example, in one test suite of sessions measuring
N      the XF86 X server on Linux, using a trim threshold of 128K and a
N      mmap threshold of 192K led to near-minimal long term resource
N      consumption.
N
N      If you are using this malloc in a long-lived program, it should
N      pay to experiment with these values.  As a rough guide, you
N      might set to a value close to the average size of a process
N      (program) running on your system.  Releasing this much memory
N      would allow such a process to run in memory.  Generally, it's
N      worth it to tune for trimming rather tham memory mapping when a
N      program undergoes phases where several large chunks are
N      allocated and released in ways that can reuse each other's
N      storage, perhaps mixed with phases where there are no such
N      chunks at all.  And in well-behaved long-lived programs,
N      controlling release of large blocks via trimming versus mapping
N      is usually faster.
N
N      However, in most programs, these parameters serve mainly as
N      protection against the system-level effects of carrying around
N      massive amounts of unneeded memory. Since frequent calls to
N      sbrk, mmap, and munmap otherwise degrade performance, the default
N      parameters are set to relatively high values that serve only as
N      safeguards.
N
N      The default trim value is high enough to cause trimming only in
N      fairly extreme (by current memory consumption standards) cases.
N      It must be greater than page size to have any useful effect.  To
N      disable trimming completely, you can set to (unsigned long)(-1);

N/*
N    M_TOP_PAD is the amount of extra `padding' space to allocate or
N      retain whenever sbrk is called. It is used in two ways internally:
N
N      * When sbrk is called to extend the top of the arena to satisfy
N	a new malloc request, this much padding is added to the sbrk
N	request.
N
N      * When malloc_trim is called automatically from free(),
N	it is used as the `pad' argument.
N
N      In both cases, the actual amount of padding is rounded
N      so that the end of the arena is always a system page boundary.
N
N      The main reason for using padding is to avoid calling sbrk so
N      often. Having even a small pad greatly reduces the likelihood
N      that nearly every malloc request during program start-up (or
N      after trimming) will invoke sbrk, which needlessly wastes
N      time.
N
N      Automatic rounding-up to page-size units is normally sufficient
N      to avoid measurable overhead, so the default is 0.  However, in
N      systems where sbrk is relatively slow, it can pay to increase
N      this value, at the expense of carrying around more memory than
N      the program needs.

N
N    M_MMAP_THRESHOLD is the request size threshold for using mmap()
N      to service a request. Requests of at least this size that cannot
N      be allocated using already-existing space will be serviced via mmap.
N      (If enough normal freed space already exists it is used instead.)
N
N      Using mmap segregates relatively large chunks of memory so that
N      they can be individually obtained and released from the host
N      system. A request serviced through mmap is never reused by any
N      other request (at least not directly; the system may just so
N      happen to remap successive requests to the same locations).
N
N      Segregating space in this way has the benefit that mmapped space
N      can ALWAYS be individually released back to the system, which
N      helps keep the system level memory demands of a long-lived
N      program low. Mapped memory can never become `locked' between
N      other chunks, as can happen with normally allocated chunks, which
N      menas that even trimming via malloc_trim would not release them.
N
N      However, it has the disadvantages that:
N
N	 1. The space cannot be reclaimed, consolidated, and then
N	    used to service later requests, as happens with normal chunks.
N	 2. It can lead to more wastage because of mmap page alignment
N	    requirements
N	 3. It causes malloc performance to be more dependent on host
N	    system memory management support routines which may vary in
N	    implementation quality and may impose arbitrary
N	    limitations. Generally, servicing a request via normal
N	    malloc steps is faster than going through a system's mmap.
N
N      All together, these considerations should lead you to use mmap
N      only for relatively large requests.

N	 2. In most systems, overreliance on mmap can degrade overall

N	 3. If a program allocates many large regions, it is probably
